    // we use asynchronus coding for event loop and synchronus for top level coding

    // node is single threaded    -->  code run from same part of memory
    /*
    Advantages of Single-Threaded Event Loop over Multi-Threaded Request/Response Stateless Model:

    1. Can handle more & more concurrent clientâ€™s requests with ease.
    2. Eliminates the need of creating more and more threads, because of the Event loop.
    3. Applications built on top of node.js use the least threads possible to reduce memory or resource usage.
*/       

// event loop -> JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java.
